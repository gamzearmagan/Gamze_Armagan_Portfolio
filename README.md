## Portfolio Projects
### Apple Stock Price Prediction
**Code:** [Stock_Price_Prediction](https://github.com/gamzearmagan/Stock_Price_Prediction)

**Goal:** To determine predict the Apple stock price

**Description:** The focus is on cleaning and preprocessing the data, analyzing feature correlations, and evaluating model performance using cross-validation techniques.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, linear regression, ridge regression, RandomForrest,time series analysis.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Comparassion of different machine learning tecniques with cross validation



### Image Classification

**Code:** [Image_Classication](https://github.com/gamzearmagan/Image-Clasification)

**Goal:** To classify images from the Coil100 dataset using  custom neural network model.

**Description:** This project involved building an image classification model using the Coil100 dataset, containing 100 different object classes under varying angles. Key steps included data loading, preprocessing images, constructing a deep learning model with convolutional layers, training the model, and evaluating performance on validation data. 

**Skills:** image preprocessing, convolutional neural networks (CNN), model training, data augmentation.

**Technology:** Python, PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy.

**Results:** The model achieved high validation accuracy, demonstrating robust image classification capabilities. 


### Sentiment Analysis

**Code:** [Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzearmagan/Sentiment_Analysis)

**Goal:** To analyze and classify text data into positive or negative sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

**Description:** This project focused on building a sentiment analysis model to categorize textual data. Key steps included text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization using TF-IDF), feature extraction, and training machine learning models. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes were implemented, and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Skills:** text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, sentiment classification, model evaluation, Natural Language Processing (NLP).

**Technology:** Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas.

**Results:** The Logistic Regression model demonstrated higher accuracy and precision compared to Naive Bayes, effectively classifying text data into positive and negative sentiment categories.
